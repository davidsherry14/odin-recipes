  <h2>Description</h2>
  <b
    >This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes
    this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak
    that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on
    flavor to save a few calories.</b

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly
      oil the grate
    </li>
    <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat</li>
    <li>Stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside</li>
    <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper</li>
    <li>
      Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An
      instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees
      F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness

    <li>
      Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic
      butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving
